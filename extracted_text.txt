using html, css and js create a web page with 4 tables, each table should have a header with column Date and Ending Balance. the purpose of the tables is to compare daily ending balances of bank statements side by side, so use will drop a statement pdf it will be sent to backend for processing and table one will be populates then repeat process for up to 4 tables. but because we are optimizing the page for vertical space to avoid scrolling down to see all transactions be wise we how you design the dropzone, also have a way to clear tables, not that api will come after we finish UI

We only need one dropzone and 4 tables below it when user drops a file you need to check what table is not populated and when results come back add rows, also make sure you plan for a scenario where user drops files one after the other while previous request is still processing in such a scenario make sure you don't overwrite results of previous requests and if all tables are populated user need to clear tables before they can drop other files.

also to optimize for vertical space the dropzone should be collapsable to allow tables to occumpy the whole page height, also in such a case i also want to be able to still drag and drop files on the page so whenever the page detects a drop event on any part of the page show a message like "drop file to process" with a nice page overlay or whole page background blur
